Pipeline to run SMR using nominal QTLtools output

Note: You need to have 22 files (one for each chromosome) to run this pipeline. Each of the shell scripts is set up to submit 22 jobs.

1- Run nominal_sQTL_file_processing.sh
	-This shell script runs nominal_sQTL_file_processing.R which prepares the QTLtools output for SMR

2- Run nominal_sQTL_smr_make-besd.sh
	-This shell script runs nominal_sQTL_file_processing.R which makes the besd file SMR uses
	-There should be 3 output files *.besd, *.epi and *.esi
	-Files *.epi and *.esi will be missing some info. Such info is added in next step 

3- Run nominal_sQTL_smr_update-besd.sh
	-This shell script runs nominal_sQTL_smr_update-besd.R which updates the *.epi and *.esi files from previous step
	-GeneID info is added to 5th column in *.epi file
	-Ref, Alt, and MAF of Ref allele are added to last 3 columns of *.esi file

4- Run nominal_sQTL_smr.sh
	-This shell script runs nominal_sQTL_smr.R which runs the SMR analysis

5- Run nominal_annotate_smr_results.sh (optional)
	-This shell script runs nominal_annotate_smr_results.R which uses annotations from snpEff to annotate results

6- Run nominal_concat_smr_results.R (optional)
	-This R script concatenates the annotated results
