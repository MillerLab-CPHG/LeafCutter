Pipeline to run QTLtools

1- Make sure your vcf file is bgzipped and indexed with tabix

2- QTLtools requires special formatting of .bed.gz file. See: https://qtltools.github.io/qtltools. Run qtltools_bedfile_prep.R to make the necessary changes

3- Run QTLtools.sh to run QTLtools. Adjust covariate files and other parameters as needed

4- (Optional) After running nominal pass, files can be large and you may need to filter based on significance. Run sqtl_filter.sh which runs sqtl_filter.R to filter out pvalues greater than FDR 5%. Adjust sqtl_filter.R to change FDR threshold

5- Run sqtl_filter_concat.R to concat all the filtered files and make a master sum stats file
